# geo-sampling

A collection of geoscience based sampling tools.

## Environment

## Requirements

Required packages will be installed automatically, if not found.

## How To Use
Configurations are stored in "Run_Scripts.R" file. So, first make your changes (e.g. change the input pathes to your choice).
